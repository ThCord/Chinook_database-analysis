# Chinook_database-analysis
A SQL exploration of a fictional digital music store database.

This repository will be the opportunity to explore the Chinook database with the help of SQL and Pandas.

According to Luis Rocha, creator of the Chinook database :

        "The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and        customers.

        Media related data was created using real data from an iTunes Library. [...] 
        Customer and employee information was manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.). 
        Sales information is auto generated using random data for a four year period."
